<!-- # Quarto course website template

A template for course websites developed with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and hosted on GitHub.

Example website: https://pakillo.github.io/quarto-course-website-template (see also https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/teach-ds-course-website for a more developed example). -->
